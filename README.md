CANbus serial link over TCP

This is a bi-directional serial link using TCP. It is created using two particle io photons. It's main purpose is to transfer data from
one CANbus to another CANbus in a different building or ultimately anywhere that has connectivity.

Tested with a slow CANbus with a baud rate of 20000. This runs maximally at 150 CANbus messages per second.

This system is for private use, it will not be supported or released to the public.
